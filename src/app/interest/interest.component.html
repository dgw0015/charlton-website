   <p class="lead">One of my favorite seasons is Spring, not for the activities and holidays that happen but because of the
      flowers that bloom during those times. Seeing the creativity, personality, and ingenuity shine through each and every
      one of C. Wayman Design and Production’s arrangements sparked my love for floral design. When I first started
      working for them, I learned the basics of creating arrangements by helping them cut flowers, learning the names
      of the flowers, and understanding color schemes and matching arrangements to the entire event. Now that I’ve been
      working there for over a year, they’ve allowed me to help design smaller arrangements and use my own creativity
      and designs to create beautiful arrangements. In my free time, I put together arrangements for my apartment
      every chance I get from the leftover flowers we had at work. While it forces me to think outside the box
      because the variety of flowers changes every week, it serves as pretty décor for my counter tops and acts
      as a great stress reliever too!</p>

   <p class="lead">The smell of curry, five space, and ginger was constantly floating around in our house.
      Growing up in a Trinidadian household, food was always cooking on the stove from the moment I woke up.
      My grandfather owned a seafood restaurant in Trinidad and fortunately for us he lived with us when we moved to
      Auburn. I always wanted to know what he was cooking so every chance I got I was at the sink washing vegetables and
      cutting onions to help in any way that I could. Cooking is a form of art and requires a lot of skill, instinct,
      and imagination. The first thing I turned to on the TV was The Food Network Channel and I was constantly watching
      Chopped, Cake Boss, Iron Chef, Cutthroat Kitchen, and Worst Cooks in America. These shows taught me so much
      about cooking techniques, ingredients, names of dishes, and most importantly that there is no limit to what you
      can do with food. Ever since then I’ve been experimenting and cooking as much as I can and hopefully,
      I can go to culinary school someday.

      From my internship at Maysara Winery, I developed a new passion and respect for wine. Watching and learning and
      being hands on with the biodynamic winery, it opened my eyes to the ample amount of opportunities of how wine is
      produced, where it can be produced, and the complexity of the process. Because of this, I plan on furthering my
      studies through the Court of Master Sommeliers Course and hopefully continuing on to obtain my Certified Specialist
      of Wine certification. Not only do I love a challenge, but what better way to be educated about something so simple
      yet so extremely complex than to sample wines from all over the world.
