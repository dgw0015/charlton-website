<p class="lead">My name is Charlton Kam and I am from Auburn, AL. I am a Junior in Hospitality Management
   with a concentration in Events with a Business minor. I chose this major because of the incredible
   opportunities this program provides and the connections and relationships you can form by going through
   the program.</p>
   <p class="lead">Growing up in a Trinidadian family and growing up in the south, hospitality was something I always experienced.
   At home we were always having holiday parties, family reunions, and friends from all over coming to our house.
   We always made sure that they felt like they were in their home away from home and it was from these experiences that my love for people blossomed.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">Through my experiences shadowing event coordinators, florists, and venue coordinators and working behind the scenes
   of all different types of events, it never gets old seeing people’s excitement and joy when they walk into a room.
   Being able to watch them create lifelong memories with their friends and family is what motivates me to create the
   most memorable, outstanding events.</p>
   <p class="lead">In the future, I would like to own my own event planning business and coordinate corporate events whether it’s a
   fundraiser, conference, or small meeting. In addition, I would love to go to culinary school and learn more about
   the art of cooking as well as learn about the incredibly rich history of the wine industry. Using these skills and
   experiences that I would learn along the way, my main goal is to take people’s ideas and dreams and take extra steps
   to create an event that they did not know was possible.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">Outside of academics, you can always find me outdoors hiking or running and spending time with my friends and family.
   When I’m taking a break from the great outdoors, I’m most likely watching endless shows about cooking on The
   FoodNetwork or trying to replicate it in the kitchen.
